        "close_200_sma": "200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.",
        "close_10_ema": "10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.",
        "macd": "MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.",
        "macds": "MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.",
        "macdh": "MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.",
        "rsi": "RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.",
        "boll": "Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands. Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Tips: Combine with the upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.",
        "boll_ub": "Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line. Usage: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. Tips: Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.",
        "boll_lb": "Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.",
        "atr": "ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.",
        "vwma": "VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.",
        "mfi": "MFI: The Money Flow Index is a momentum indicator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. Usage: Identify overbought (>80) or oversold (<20) conditions and confirm the strength of trends or reversals. Tips: Use alongside RSI or MACD to confirm signals; divergence between price and MFI can indicate potential reversals."
